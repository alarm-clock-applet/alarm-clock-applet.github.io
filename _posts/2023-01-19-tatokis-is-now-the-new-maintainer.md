Hello alarm-clock contributors and users,

After a long period of being unmaintained, I am thrilled to announce that alarm-clock has a new maintainer: @tatokis!

You may have noticed a recent burst of activity in the project, with lots of improvements, bug fixes, and even a new [0.4.1 release](https://github.com/alarm-clock-applet/alarm-clock/releases/tag/0.4.1)!
All of these developments are thanks to @tatokis.

### New maintainer

As the original creator of alarm-clock, it makes me very happy to hand over the maintainership to @tatokis.
He has already made significant contributions to the code base, including porting the project to Gtk 3, GSettings, GtkApplication, GActions and a more modern CMake build system.
All of these improvements should also enable alarm-clock-applet to be packaged in modern Linux distributions.
I am confident that the project will thrive under his leadership.

**Note:** The maintainership was handed over in Nov 2022, but I felt it was appropriate with an official announcement. My apologies for the delay in making this announcement.
